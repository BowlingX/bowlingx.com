# Why React Native is Different

I've always wanted a live environment for JavaScript. There are a few solutions out there, but none 
of them have the right abstraction. Most of them require you to use a special editor, which is totally
 backwards. I want to write code in my editor, and evaluate it live.

The ideal tool is a networked REPL that is aware of your module system. 
You could interactively work inside of modules, and build tools on top of it to automatically hot-patch 
code when a module is changed. Unfortunately this is nearly impossible to build right now, 
since JavaScript does not natively have modules yet. Additionally, most advanced apps run 
JavaScript through a transformer like babeljs, so somehow the REPL needs to run the code 
through the same transformers. Making this work in all browsers and node/io.js right now would be really hard. 
In the long run, when native devtools get support for modules, it should be possible.
